Mercury is a budget web App.
 
 You can connect to your bank account by selecting your bank from the list, and entering your bank sign in information.
 You can also add your budget/sub-budgets for categories such as food and entertainment. 
 
By entering start and end days, we can compare graphs of our actual spending during that period of time to our set budget. We can also see our spending and budget in tabular form.
 
In order to help users stick to a budget, we have created an email-update system that sends monthly emails to specified friends and family about whether or not you have met your financial goals. We have two settings that you can enable or disable. The first is for general budget updates of whether or met you met your overall budget. The second setting allows you to track your spending at a specific location. The email will contain a randomized gif that either reflects whether or not we met our overall budget or our specified location, depending on the settings we chose.
